    description: Getting started with the derp.trade app
---

derp.trade is in beta, and accessible [here](https://app.derp.trade). You can use it with a list of predefined assets. 

The contracts are deployed on Solana devnet. To get devnet funds, you can use the [Solana faucet](https://faucet.solana.com/).

The beta version of the app implements the fundamental features of DERPs. It only supports market orders.
