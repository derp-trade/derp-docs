derp.trade was created by moonboy and Antoni Kiszka, two founders with a passion for open protocols and decentralized finance. We welcome contributions from anyone who wants to help us build a more open and accessible financial system.

Antoni started coding at the age of 13. He has a background in mathematics and computer science, and has worked on various projects in the fields of finance, gaming, and web development. His first company, a blockchain software development firm, was founded in 2022. He is also a co-founder of synergy.markets, a social trading platform. 

Moonboy is a financial engineer turned degen. He worked in finance and business analytics, and now he is a candidate Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). He is a skilled analyst and has a strong understanding of financial markets. His focus is on making sure DERPs are sound and secure.

Building a new protocol is a difficult task, which the co-founders are uniquely qualified to do. The team welcomes all outside contributions, and is always looking for suggestions and feedback, especially from the [beta testers group](https://t.me/derpsbeta).

We would like to recognize all prior work that enabled the development of this protocol. The following projects are the most important ones:
- [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) - the original AMM exchange
- [Raydium](https://raydium.io/) - the original AMM on Solana
- [Hyperliquid](https://hyperfoundation.org/) - a decentralized perpetuals exchange
