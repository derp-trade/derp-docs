The fees in derp.trade are simple. They are calculated as 5 bps (0.05%) of the notional value of every trade. This means that the fee is charged on the total value of the trade, regardless of the size of the position or the leverage used.

The fee is charged in USD, and is deducted from the funds used to open the position (when opening) or from the sale proceeds (when closing). The fee is not charged on the unrealized PnL, and is not included in the calculation of the account value.

Currently, there are no rebates or volume discounts, but this may change in the future.
